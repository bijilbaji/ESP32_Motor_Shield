This library is designed for use with the Arduino Motor Shield, specifically the affordable dual L293D motor shield, and the ESP32-based Wemos D1 32 board. It currently supports control of up to four DC motors. Note that stepper motor functionality has not yet been implemented.

The pin map for the Clones seems to be diffrent from current adafruit version so bit map has be updated. Check the model properly

A reference image of the shield setup for the Wemos D1 32 and Arduino Motor Shield is provided for guidance.
